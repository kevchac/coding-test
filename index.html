                <p>Surtsey ("Surtr's island" in Icelandic, Icelandic pronunciation:
                    ​[ˈsʏr̥(t)sˌeiː]) is a volcanic island located in the Vestmannaeyjar 
                    archipelago off the southern coast of Iceland. At WikiMiniAtlas63.303°N 20.605°W
                    Coordinates: 63.303°N 20.605°W, Surtsey is the southernmost point of Iceland.[1] 
                    It was formed in a volcanic eruption which began 130 metres (430 feet) below sea level,
                    and reached the surface on 14 November 1963. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when
                    the island reached its maximum size of 2.7 km2 (1.0 sq mi). Since then, wave erosion has 
                    caused the island to steadily diminish in size: as of 2012, its surface area was 1.3 km2 
                    (0.50 sq mi).[2] The most recent survey (2007) shows the island's maximum elevation at 155 m (509 ft) above sea level.[3]
